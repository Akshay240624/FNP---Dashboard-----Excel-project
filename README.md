## Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive data analysis of an e-commerce platform's sales and customer data (referred to as FNP data). The goal was to transform raw transactional data, customer information, and product details into actionable insights using advanced Excel features like Pivot Tables, formulas, and data manipulation. The analysis focuses on understanding revenue drivers, product performance, customer behavior, and operational efficiency (delivery time) across various months and sales occasions.

## Key Metrics & Analysis
The analysis derived insights across several dimensions of the business:

Overall Performance: Calculated total revenue, total number of orders (1000 orders), and average customer spending (3520.984).

Time-Based Analysis: Revenue and order volume trended across all months of the year (January to December) to identify peak sales periods (e.g., high revenue noted in February and August/November).

Product Performance: Identified the top-performing product categories (e.g., Colors, Soft Toys, Cake) and individual product names based on total revenue generation.

Occasion-Based Sales: Analyzed revenue distribution across key sales events, including Valentine's Day, Anniversary, Birthday, Holi, and Diwali, to understand seasonal demand.

Operational Efficiency: Calculated the Average Delivery Time (â‰ˆ5.53 days) to gauge logistics performance.

Customer Segmentation: Used customer and order data to explore purchasing patterns based on location and gender.

## Tools & Technologies
Primary Tool: Microsoft Excel (or Google Sheets)

Techniques Used: Data cleaning, VLOOKUP/INDEX-MATCH for data merging, Pivot Tables for aggregation, Calculated Fields, and Data Visualization (Charts/Graphs, which would be in the original Excel file).
